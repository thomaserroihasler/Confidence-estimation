# Confidence Estimation

Confidence Estimation is a comprehensive project focused on assessing and improving the reliability of confidence scores produced by machine learning models, particularly in the context of classification tasks.

Aimed at enhancing confidence estimation, using image transformations to extract local information on certainty.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Dependencies include:

- Python 3.x
- Torch (PyTorch)
- TorchVision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd path-to-your-project
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

### Executing program

- To run the entire pipeline, use the provided bash script `simple_protocol.bash`. This script sequentially executes all the necessary Python scripts located in different subfolders.
  
  ```bash
  bash simple_protocol.bash
  ```

- Individual Python scripts can also be run separately if required.
