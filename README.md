# Confidence Estimation

Confidence Estimation is a comprehensive project focused on assessing and improving the reliability of confidence scores produced by machine learning models, particularly in the context of classification tasks.

## Description

This project implements a series of Python scripts designed to train, validate, and test machine learning models, with an emphasis on evaluating their confidence estimation. It includes techniques like temperature scaling and Gaussian kernel application to improve and assess model calibration. The project is suited for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding and enhancing the reliability of their predictive models.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Dependencies include:

- Python 3.x
- Torch (PyTorch)
- TorchVision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd path-to-your-project
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

### Executing program

- To run the entire pipeline, use the provided bash script `simple_protocol.bash`. This script sequentially executes all the necessary Python scripts located in different subfolders.
  
  ```bash
  bash simple_protocol.bash
  ```

- Individual Python scripts can also be run separately if required.
